# credit-risk-classification
## Module 20

### Project Description

Loan approval is a complex task, taking many factors into account to minimize risk for the lender before approval is granted. Machine learning algorithms work well with complex data that includes many features. This project aims to create a machine learning model, fit it to peer-to-peer loan data, and try to predict the creditworthiness of borrowers into two categories (healthy loans and high-risk loans). 

### Execution

Execute credit_risk_classification.ipynb in the Credit_Risk folder. The generated outputs and analysis will be available there. Read the Report file in this repo for a quick breakdown of the project.

### Features

Jupyter notebook is used to run the code. Modules included are Numpy, Pandas, Pathlib, and Sklearn. From Sklearn, the confusion_matrix, classification_report, LogisticRegression, and train_test_split functions were used. 

### Contributors

EdX class code and data were used for the entire project.
